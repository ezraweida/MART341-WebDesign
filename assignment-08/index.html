<h1>Lyrics</h1>
<p>I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
    In the front seat of his car
    He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
    The other on my heart
    I look around, turn the radio down
    He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"
    I say, "Nothing, I was just thinking how we don't have a song"
    And he says
</p>
<p>Our song is the slamming screen door
    Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
    When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
    'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
    Our song is the way you laugh
    The first date; "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
    And when I got home, 'fore I said "Amen"
    Asking God if he could play it again    
</p>

<p>I was walkin' up the front porch steps after everything that day
    Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
    And lost and thrown away
    Got to the hallway, well on my way
    To my lovin' bed
    I almost didn't notice all the roses
    And the note that said
</p>

<p>Our song is the slamming screen door
    Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
    When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
    'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
    Our song is the way you laugh
    The first date; "Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have"
    And when I got home, 'fore I said "Amen"
    Asking God if he could play it again
</p>
<p>I've heard every album, listened to the radio
    Waited for something to come along
    That was as good as our song
</p>
<p>
    'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
    Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
    When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
    'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
    Our song is the way he laughs
    The first date; "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
    And when I got home, 'fore I said "Amen"
    Askin' God if he could play it again
    Play it again
    Oh yeah
    Oh, oh yeah
</p>
<p>
    I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
    In the front seat of his car
    I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
    And I wrote down our song    
</p>
