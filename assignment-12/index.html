            "The two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in the narrow,
            moonlit lane. For a second they stood quite still, wands directed at each other's
            chests; then, recognizing each other, they stowed their wands beneath their
            cloaks and started walking briskly in the same direction.
             "News?" asked the taller of the two. "

            ""The best," replied Severus Snape.
            The lane was bordered on the left by wild, low-growing brambles, on the right by
            a high, neatly manicured hedge. The men's long cloaks flapped around their
            ankles as they marched."

            ""Thought I might be late," said Yaxley, his blunt features sliding in and out of
            sight as the branches of overhanging trees broke the moonlight. "It was a little trickier than I expected. But I hope he will be satisfied. You sound confident that
            your reception will be good?""
